        HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it&apos;s the “code”
        behind every webpage – even this one. If you&apos;re just beginning to learn
        HTML, let us tell you that it&apos;s a fairly easy task. HTML, without
        styling, can&apos;t do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table,
        or creating frames – but it is handy as it helps you structure the
        content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to
        your HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
        to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
        coding from your work process – but if you want to be in full control of
        your web-page, you&apos;ll need to have some command over HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building
        blocks that&apos;ll help you get up and running. Reading this, you&apos;ll be able
        to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!
      </p>
      <h3>Step One - TAGS</h3>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
      <p>
        Tags are what you&apos;ll see the most when you look at any HTML source code.
        A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML
        document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s look at two types of tags:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          &lttag-example-1&gtI need a closign tag&lttag-example-1&gt
        </li>
        <li>
          &lttag-example-2/&gtI don't need a cloding tag.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one
        is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag.
        Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
        commonly used examples of such tags are &lthtml&gt, &lthead&gt,
        &ltbody&gt, &ltstrong&gt, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second example tags about loner tags – as in, they don&apos;t need a
        closing tag to function. Although it&apos;s not required, these type of tags
        are often written as &lttag /&gt to make the debugging of code easier.
        Common examples of such tags are &lthr/&gt – used for horizontal line,
        &ltbr/&gt – to break the line, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step Two – HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document
      </h3>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg" />
      <p>
        These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the
        significant parts of your HTML code.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &ltBODY&gt &lt/BODY&gt is placed below your &ltHEAD&gt tag, and
          everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under
          this tag. Text, images, links, and pretty much anything you can see in
          your browser live inside this tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          &ltHTML&gt &lt/HTML&gt wraps your entire code. Everything else in your
          HTML document needs to come inside these tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          &ltHEAD&gt &lt/HEAD&gt includes things like title, styles, and
          scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!), just inside the
          &lt/HTML&gt tag.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Step three – A few tags that&apos;ll make your page pretty
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let&apos;s
        proceed with the things that will go inside your &ltBODY&gt tag and do
        some magic!
      </p>
      <p>
        Some basic text formatting tags:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &ltb&gt &lt/b&gt makes your text look bold
        </li>
        <li>
          &lti&gt &lt/i&gt makes you write in cursive
        </li>
        <li>
          &ltu&gt &lt/u&gt <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, this piece of code
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
      <pre>&lthtml&gt
  
  &lthead&gt &lt/head&gt

  &ltbody&gt

    &lti&gt I am italics! &lt/i&gt &ltbr/&gt
    &ltb&gt I am bold! &lt/b&gt &ltbr/&gt
    &ltu&gt And me,well, I'm underlined! &lt/u&gt &ltbr/&gt
    
  &lt/body&gt

&lt/html&gt</pre>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        Should produce something like this on your browser: Don&apos;t fret too much
        about the &ltbr /&gt. It&apos;s just for breaking the line so that you can start
        from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing
        lines in your HTML document.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Tags to help you structure your content:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &ltbr/&gt breaks the line, making you continue to the next line
        </li>
        <li>
          &ltp&gt stands for paragraph. It divides your content into paragraphs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i
          >Note: you need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very
          little when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Heading Tags:</b></p>
      <p>
        HTML provides you with six tags, from &lth1&gt&lt/h1&gt to
        &lth6&gt&lt/h6&gt to help you create different sized headers quickly.
      </p>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" />
      <p><b>Inserting an Image:</b></p>
      <p>
        All that&apos;s good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don&apos;t
        worry, &ltimg /&gt to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute
        called “source”. Basically, it tells the browser where it should look
        for the image. The syntax goes something like:
      </p>
      <p><i>< img src = “path_to_your_image” /></i></p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you
        specify the height and width you want your image to take.
      </p>
      <p><b>Lists:</b></p>
      <p>
        HTML has two types of lists – ordered and unordered. Each item of your
        list has to be enclosed in a tag. The syntax for creating a list is
        fairly simple.
      </p>
      <p>Suppose you want to create a list like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following code will easily do the job for you:
      </p>
      <hr />
      
          <pre>&ltul&gt 
  &ltli&gtItem 1&lt/li&gt
  &ltli&gtItem 2&lt/li&gt
  &ltli&gtItem 3&lt/li&gt 
&lt/ul&gt</pre>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered
        list, all you need to do is replace &ltul&gt with &ltol&gt and &lt/ul&gt
        with &lt/ol&gt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s see what the following code does:
      </p>
      <hr />
      <pre>&lthtml&gt 

    &lthead&gt &lt/head&gt
    
    &ltbody&gt
    
        &ltul&gt
            &ltli&gt I am unordered list's item 1! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am unordered list's item 2! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am unordered list's item 3! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am unordered list's item 4! &lt/li&gt
        &lt/ul&gt 
        &ltol&gt 
            &ltli&gt I am ordered list's item 1! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am ordered list's item 2! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am ordered list's item 3! &lt/li&gt
            &ltli&gt I am ordered list's item 4! &lt/li&gt
        &lt/ol&gt
    
    &lt/body&gt
    
&lt/html&gt</pre>
      <hr />
      <hr />
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001489.png" />
      <p>
        All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with a
        simple webpage consisting of images, headings, and lists. Further, there
        are various tags that HTML supports, and we thoroughly recommend you to
        check them out and play with them!
      </p>
      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        You now know enough to skim through and understand any part of an HTML
        code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source
        code of any website (you&apos;ll find some tags you don&apos;t know, but that&apos;s
        how you learn!). Oh, and welcome to the world of web development. With
        HTML under your belt, your next stop should be making your page look
        beautiful using CSS.
